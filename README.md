SE-spam-detector-izer-er
========================

Detects spam across the Stack Exchange network immediately as it's posted.

Run `userscript.js` on http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime. It will beep when it detects spam, and highlight the spammy post. It also can post to a chatroom automatically when it detects spam.
